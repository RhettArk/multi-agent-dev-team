# Knowledge Base

Shared memory that prevents drift across all specialist work.

## Structure

- `kb/backend-patterns.md` - Backend conventions
- `kb/frontend-patterns.md` - Frontend conventions
- `kb/api-contracts.md` - API schemas and contracts
- `kb/decisions.log` - Append-only decision history
- `kb/dependencies.json` - Cross-domain dependency graph

## Usage

**Before work (pre-flight):**
- Read relevant pattern files
- Check decision log for precedent

**During work (monitoring):**
- Reference patterns for consistency
- Update patterns if establishing new conventions

**After work (validation):**
- Log decisions with rationale
- Update dependencies if contracts changed
